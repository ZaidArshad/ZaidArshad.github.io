            NETPARDY! is a web based version of jeopardy where you 
            respond to hints using questions. We used sockets for 
            connectivity and PyQt for our graphical user interface.

            I spent a significant amount of time designing the structure and 
            flow of the application. Since we used networking and a GUI we 
            needed multiple threads to prevent hanging. We also managed a 
            server-client relationship to broadcast data across multiple clients. 
            There would be a thread each for the interface, sending data to the server, 
            and listening for data from the server. Every client will be attached to 
            the server using a TCP connection over a socket. Each client will have its 
            own server assigned thread to listen and send messages back and forth.

        <TextDescription title='Message Header'>
            The client attaches a header to every message that gets casted
            to the server. In the header, the key, “SEND_TYPE” defines who is
            sending the message. There are three possible values for this,
            “BROADCAST”, “CLIENT” and “SERVER”. “BROADCAST” tells the server
            to broadcast this current message to all other clients. “CLIENT”
            is for the server to differentiate between a regular and broadcast
            message. Conversely, “SERVER” is for the client to pick apart
            the server and broadcasted messages.

        <TextDescription title='Messaging Scheme'>
            <p>
            We used a token messaging scheme. There are 2 files in the repository 
            &#40;client_tokens.json and server_tokens.json&#41; that show what each token includes.
            The descriptions for each token will be in tokens.py as that is a shared place
            for both client and server to access them. As for the content of the messages,
            keys.py has descriptions for each of them.

            There are various shared objects in the game such as the question board, 
            buzzer and the textbox. The question board is shared amongst all the 
            players and only one player can select a question on the board when it 
            is their turn to select a question. Following the game of Jeopardy, the 
            player who answers the question correctly gets to select the next 
            question and at the start of the game, the first player to connect 
            is allowed to choose the first question.
